## Introduction

The goal of this system is to reduce injuries and fatalities due to automobile backup rollovers by introducing rear sonar detection, driver alerts, and automatic vehicle speed reduction. Broadly, the system will be expected to detect objects behind the vehicle within a stated range and field of view; sound alerts when objects larger than a known minimum size are within a maximum distance; limit the speed of the vehicle when objects are within a defined hazardous range; and stop the vehicle when objects are within an immediately dangerous critical range. The system should react quickly to the presence of objects, produce extremely few false negatives, and minimize false positives. Lastly, it will aim to be as cost-effective as possible, so as to maximize deployment and remain affordable in the event of likely regulatory action mandating its installment in the future.

## Assumptions

The Backup Rollover Preventation (BRP) system will be expected to be used in "normal" low-speed driving and parking situations. It will not be expected to function during operation over 15 km/h, nor will it be installed in vehicles used for activities such as racing. We also will not expect it to be used in fleet vehicles (police or fire) where reliable close-quarters operation can be critical.
