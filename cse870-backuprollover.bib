	abstract = {Software plays a vital role in operating modern automobiles, and it is a key element in providing innovative features such as Collision Prevention System. There are two essential issues to be resolved; managing software complexity, and reducing software cost and time-to-market. A key solution to these two issues is to maximize reusing components in building various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). Component-based development (CBD) is regarded as an effective reuse technology. However, current CBD methodologies do not effectively support developing reusable automotive components and ECUs. Hence, in this paper, we first define variability types and variation points for ECUs. Based on the variability types, we propose a component-based development process for developing ECUs. To assess the applicability of the proposed CBD process, we present the case study of developing an innovative automotive ECU for Automatic Parking System (APS).},
